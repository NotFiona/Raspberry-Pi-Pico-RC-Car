# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-RC-Car
**Under Construction**

## Project information
This is the page for my first Raspberry Pi project, an RC Car built on Raspberry Pi Pico with Bluetooth control.
Why do this?  It's purely an educational endeavor to learn more about all of the components involved.
Why did I choose the parts?  The parts selection was also a learning experience, so there may be better parts.  I'm open to suggestions!!

## Parts list (work in progress)
Raspberry Pi Pico

[DC Gearbox Motor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3777)

[L9110H Motor Driver chip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4489)

HC05 Serial Bluetooth - various sites, I ordered this through Amazon

More parts TBD

## What is next?
Other than designing and building it?  Figuring out how to do it better?  If I'm happy with it, maybe design a 3d printed chasis?
